TODO list:

sort previous code and pick useful code/idea from it

finish 2d/3d pixel block model + bone animation  + model making tool, 
use JS, the data struct, data flow, and higher update logic is what matters this time
it has no direct game logic, but can change to a game base code.
need to check the run speed
actual visual effect
content making complexity level




the future game will be custom pixel + advice based ai + pixel 2d ui, all in JS(should work at 20~30fps)
client will need feature mixing
sound is not considered yet




fast prototyping rule:
	the total structure may be just wrong, so keep data & logic seperate and organized




some specifics:
	pixel:
		pixel box: now 8 x 8 size
		default character: 3 x 2 x 2 pixel box size == 24 x 16 x 16 pixel
		default ground: 1 x 1 x 1 pixel box
		item: n x n x n pixel box
	
	graphic:
		designed FPS: 24 or more
		screen pixel: 
			600 x 400 (table screen)
			300 x 200 (phone)
			
	game play:
		both turned and action
		
	skill system:
