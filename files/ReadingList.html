<h1>Some Notes</h1>
About AI
	Popular Methods:
		Neural network	--	feedback is pre-defined(mostly)
		Behaviour tree	--	maximum potential limited
		
	Focus Aspect:
		Input:
			Processing
			Classify
		
		
		
	Preferred AI Model for a Game:
		will be run every frame:
			no non-stoppable looping
			breakable, re-enter-able
		like function:
			data in, data out
		change-able at run-time
		can be stored by save files
		per actor in game
		can be changed by:
			copying other AI
			try and error
			additional scripting
		
		the data a game can offer:(from simple to complex)
			storage for initial data
			storage for run-time data
			storage for accumulating data
			list of actions available
			data of "self"
			data of environment
			data of feedback/result(before commit action or after)
			notification/event of perceived actions
			data/function of how favorable of a status data or a status change
			
			
		
	The ADVICE Model:
		AI keeps a List/Trees of Advices
		an Advice is consists of:
			Aspect:	(aspect of this advice, loose restraint, where player may tweak a lot)
				combat
				daily
				long-term
				...
				
			Condition:	(some thing need checked before use)
				Time
				Location
				Resource
				Target
				...
				
			Slot: (keywords, for some advice will occupy some slot and prevent same type advice)
				Mission
				Move
				Attack
				...
				
			Action:	(the result action to take, will also be checked)
				Use
				Move
				...
				
			Source:	(the source of this advice, the source has a credit(objective) value, a favor(subjective) value)
				system (predefined)
				ally (predefined, per AI)
				enemy (predefined, per AI)
				self
				AI001
				AI002
				...
				
			Opinion:
				Credit: (objective, how this advice is considered by other AI)
				Favor: (subjective, how this advice is considered by this AI)
				
		On each update, some Advice about something will be Read, some will fail on Condition check, Action check, or even Source-favorable check
		
		AI keeps a List of Sources, not only for a quick back link from Advice, but also can be use as a contact book, and the "Recognition" logic
			List:
				Source:
					Opinion:
						Credit:	(objective, how advice from this source is considered by other AI)
						Favor:	(subjective, how advice from this source is considered by this AI)
		
		AI itself, as a source of advice will have some data related:
			Opinion:
				Credit:	(objective, how advice from this source is considered by other AI)
				Favor:	(subjective, how advice from this source is considered by this AI, it can be a low value, indicating this AI is lack of confidence and make wrong decisions)
			
		The Opinion value is used to create a Emotion-like decision process, for decision consideration:
			Credit: True - Fake
			Favor: True - Fake
			??Confidence: Strong - Weak (decide the attack/flee action) -- denied, the attack/flee action is an action, not opinion
			
		AI keeps a List of Interact-able Object(Other AI or just environment), not only for a quick back link from Advice, but also can be use as a contact book, and the "Recognition" logic
			List:
				Source:
					Opinion:
						Credit:	(objective, how overall advice is considered by other AI)
						Favor:	(subjective, how overall advice is considered by this AI)
