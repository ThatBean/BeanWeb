Logic - Change Logic / Motion State by Actor's Data

		{ALWAYS RUN} When Logic State Change Check
			{ALWAYS RUN} Active State Change Check
				[if] Mute move

				[if] Immune attacked
					{CHOOSE ONE TO RUN} Condition Check
						Affected

						Ignored
			
			[data] Actor Is Mute Move
			[data] Actor Is Mute Attack

			{ALWAYS RUN} Actor Status Caused State Change Check

				[data] Actor Attack Range Trigger
			
			Move
				Position
				Target
				
				CheckAttackRangeTrigger (Check enemy)
				
				[data] Actor Attack Range Trigger

			? Defend ?
				(Increase defence, no move no attack)
			
			Attack / Active
				AttackPrepare
					[if] Melee -- Warrior / Knight
					[if] Range -- Archer / Wizard

					[if] Boss
					[if] Upgrade to Stronger version ? (Normal - Strong Attack)
					? [if] Monster () ?
				Trigger  (Init skill object)
				Active   (Lasting skill)
				Finish   (Leave skill control - skill object may still remain)
			
			Special (Incontrollable)
				Combinable(caused by buff)
					[if] Delayed    (Timed - Appers Idle / Attacked, Then Resume Last State??)
					[if] Freezed    (Timed - Keep Motion State, Stop Motion)
						[if] Colored    (Timed - Colored)
					[if] Fear       (Timed - Run Back)
				Pushed(caused by attack)   (Timed / !Distance! - Pushed Back)
				Celebrate(caused by system)
			
			Born
				MoveTo
				PlaceAt
				Reborn
			
			Dead
				Meet Pre-set Condition
				No Health
