Data & Time

By now the speed of the CPU in my PC is likely 4GHz, duo/quad cores. Meaning (4 * 1,000,000,000) changes/calculations taking place in 1sec in the circuit.(1Hz = 1Click/Second, 1G = 1,000,000,000)
While normal game is expected to have a stable 60Hz refresh rate, and assuming average C requires 10 changes/calculations per line, we currently have about 1,000,000 capacity of running C code. How fast it is! Even in script language like JavaScript/Lua we may still have 100,000 line capacity for one refresh. 
Most Phone CPUs now have reached 1GHz speed, but let's make the average at 500MHz(a bit low), we can still do 100,000 C lines or 10,000 Script lines.

The Memory runs at 1600MHz, or 1033MHz, so the switch is 10 times slower than CPU, meaning the CPU has to wait for data coming through.

The SATA Disk has a 10MB/s data transfer speed, 100MB/s for SSD.

We sometimes watch a 720P movie (1.5GB), for 2 hours, with a 5000 word after-view-post (400KB). Meaning we need 2hour to process 1,5GB data for 400KB?
